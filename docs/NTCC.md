# `Scraping` the Web using `Python`! :D

## `Python 101`

`Python` is an extremely basic dialect, and has an exceptionally clear syntax. 
It urges software engineers to program without standard (arranged) code. 
The least complex order in `Python` is the `print` mandate - it essentially prints out a line (and furthermore incorporates a new line, not at all like in `C`).  

There are two noteworthy `Python` variants, `Python2` and `Python3`. 
`Python2` and `3` are altogether different from one another. 
This paper utilizes `Python3`, since it all the more semantically right and incorporates even new features. 

For instance, one contrast between `Python2` and 3 is the `print` articulation. 
In `Python2`, the `print` statement is not a function, and in this way it is summoned without enclosures (brackets). 
Be that as it may, in `Python3`, it is a function, and must be conjured with enclosures.  

`Python` is not only `object-oriented` but also a `funtional paradigm`.
