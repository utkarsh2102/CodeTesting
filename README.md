# CodeTesting
<This is a junk repo>

This repository contains all the testing code while pushing the changes to the upstream.
It mostly contains READMEs and some other untested code for testing and reviewing purposes.
And suggestions and contributions are heartily welcomed.

Presently, working on Pledge-India.  
(Status==Completed;)

To contribute, ping me anywhere. Available everywhere by @utkarsh2102.
